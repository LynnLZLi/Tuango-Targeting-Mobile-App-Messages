# Tuango-Targeting-Mobile-App-Messages

### Project Description:
In this comprehensive project, I conducted an in-depth analysis and model development for Tuango, a "deal-of-the-day" website in China similar to Groupon, focusing on optimizing their marketing strategies through mobile app push notifications. The primary tasks involved evaluating the true marginal cost of message pushes, building targeting models, performing profitability analysis, and ultimately submitting the code and results to GitHub.

### Technology Stack:
- **Data Handling and Scripting**: Python
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyRSM
- **Data Storage**: Utilizing Parquet files for data reading and storage
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Data Preprocessing and Preliminary Analysis**:
   - Processed the Tuango dataset to calculate the response rate to push messages and the average number of sessions purchased.
   - Analyzed user purchase behavior to determine the acceptance of push messages.

2. **Building Targeting Models**:
   - Analyzed factors influencing purchase responses and order sizes using logistic and linear regression models.
   - Ranked the importance of model variables and assessed the impact of various variables using permutation importance techniques.

3. **Profitability Analysis**:
   - Calculated the breakeven response rate for push messages and based marketing strategies on this calculation.
   - Compared profitability between targeting all customers and those identified by predictive models.
   - Visually presented profitability and marketing return on investment (ROI) under different strategies through charts.

4. **Automation and Code Management**:
   - Ensured code reproducibility and managed versions using GitHub workflows.
   - Organized the complete analysis process and results in a Jupyter notebook and submitted it to GitHub.

### Key Outcomes:
- **Efficient Data Management**: Established a comprehensive workflow from data processing to model analysis, enhancing data accessibility and readiness for analysis.
- **Enhanced Analytical Capabilities**: Provided data-driven business insights for Tuango, helping the company better understand customer behaviors and preferences.
- **Automation and Scalability**: Implemented automated processes for data handling and analysis, providing scalable solutions for future data sources or analytical requirements, ensuring adaptability to business needs.
